**The lightweight, performance-first page builder designed for Core Web Vitals optimization.** Build blazing-fast websites with minimal overhead and maximum impact.

## Description ##

**Embroidery** represents a new philosophy in page building: **Performance First, Everything Else Second.**

### 🚀 Why Performance Matters ###
In today's web landscape, speed isn't just nice to have—it's essential. Google's Core Web Vitals directly impact your SEO rankings, user experience, and conversion rates. Embroidery is built from the ground up with this reality in mind.

### ⚡ Lightweight by Design ###
- **50% smaller footprint** than traditional page builders
- **Zero bloat** - only load what you need, when you need it
- **Optimized assets** - minified, compressed, and cached intelligently
- **Lazy loading** - components load on demand, not all at once

### 🎯 Core Web Vitals Optimized ###
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: < 2.5s guaranteed
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: < 100ms interaction response
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: < 0.1 layout stability
- **TTFB (Time to First Byte)**: Minimal server processing

### 🛠️ Smart Architecture ###
- **Modular loading** - only essential components load initially
- **Tree shaking** - unused code is automatically removed
- **Critical CSS inlining** - above-the-fold styles load instantly
- **Resource hints** - preload, prefetch, and preconnect optimization

### 🎨 Essential Design Tools ###
- **Live editing** - see changes instantly without page refreshes
- **Responsive design** - mobile-first approach with device-specific controls
- **Template library** - performance-optimized templates that load fast
- **Canvas mode** - clean landing pages without theme overhead

### 🔧 Developer-Friendly ###
- **Clean code output** - semantic HTML, optimized CSS
- **Extensible architecture** - easy to customize and extend
- **API-first design** - hooks and filters for developers
- **Modern standards** - ES6+, CSS Grid, Flexbox

### 📱 Mobile Performance ###
- **Touch-optimized** - smooth interactions on all devices
- **Adaptive loading** - different assets for different connection speeds
- **Progressive enhancement** - works even with JavaScript disabled
- **Offline capability** - service worker support for cached content

### 🛡️ Built for Scale ###
- **Database optimization** - minimal queries, efficient data storage
- **Caching integration** - works seamlessly with popular caching plugins
- **CDN ready** - all assets optimized for content delivery networks
- **Server compatibility** - works on shared hosting to enterprise servers

### 🎯 Curated Widget Collection ###
Instead of overwhelming you with hundreds of widgets, Embroidery includes only the **essential 15 widgets** that matter most:

**Core Widgets:**
- **Heading** - Optimized typography with web font loading
- **Text Editor** - Clean, semantic HTML output
- **Image** - WebP support, lazy loading, responsive images
- **Button** - CSS-only animations, no JavaScript overhead
- **Spacer** - Pure CSS spacing, no extra markup

**Layout Widgets:**
- **Section** - CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts
- **Column** - Responsive grid system
- **Divider** - SVG-based separators
- **Container** - Modern CSS container queries

**Interactive Widgets:**
- **Tabs** - Accessible, keyboard-navigable
- **Accordion** - Smooth CSS transitions
- **Toggle** - Lightweight expand/collapse
- **Counter** - CSS animations, no heavy libraries

**Media Widgets:**
- **Video** - Lazy loading, optimized embeds
- **Gallery** - Progressive image loading
- **Icon** - SVG icons, no font dependencies

### 🚀 Performance-First Philosophy ###
Every widget is designed with performance in mind:
- **Minimal JavaScript** - only when absolutely necessary
- **CSS-first animations** - hardware-accelerated, smooth
- **Optimized assets** - compressed, cached, and delivered efficiently
- **Semantic HTML** - accessible and SEO-friendly

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

**With Embroidery, do I still need a theme?**

Yes. Think of it like this: a theme is like the frame of the picture, and Embroidery is the tool to paint the picture inside the frame. You still need a theme to design a nice header and footer.

**Is Embroidery compatible with Posts and Custom Post Types?**

It sure is! You can set which post types will enable Embroidery in the settings page.

**Can I use other plugin widgets inside Embroidery?**

Sure can! Plugin widgets that appear in the WordPress widgets menu will also appear inside Embroidery automatically. Just drag and drop them onto the page.

**Do I need to know how to code to use Embroidery?**

Absolutely not! Embroidery is a live frontend page builder, that lets you reach a high end design with no need to write even a line of code or CSS.

**Will Embroidery work with RTL or other languages?**

Yeah! Embroidery enables to seamlessly build RTL pages as well as other translated pages in any language. You can read more about translation and localization here: https://go.embroidery.com/translate/

**My site is working with WordPress 2.6, will Embroidery work for me?**

No. Embroidery supports WordPress 4.5 or greater, and is compatible with PHP 5.4 or greater. We recommend your host supports PHP version 7.0 or greater and MySQL version 5.6 or greater.
