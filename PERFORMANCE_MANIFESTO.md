# Embroidery Performance Manifesto

## Our Core Philosophy

**Performance is not a feature—it's a fundamental requirement.**

In a world where every millisecond matters, where Google's Core Web Vitals determine your success, and where users abandon sites that don't load in under 3 seconds, we believe that performance should be the foundation of every page builder.

## The Problem We're Solving

Traditional page builders have become bloated, slow, and performance-hostile:

- **Heavy footprints**: 15-25MB plugins that slow down every page
- **Poor Core Web Vitals**: LCP > 4s, FID > 300ms, CLS > 0.25
- **Database bloat**: 20+ queries per page load
- **Asset overload**: 30+ HTTP requests, unoptimized CSS/JS
- **Memory hogs**: 50MB+ memory usage for simple pages

## Our Solution: Performance-First Design

### 1. Lightweight Architecture
- **Minimal footprint**: < 2MB total size
- **Modular loading**: Only load what you need, when you need it
- **Tree shaking**: Automatically remove unused code
- **Smart caching**: Intelligent asset caching and compression

### 2. Core Web Vitals Optimization
- **LCP < 2.5s**: Optimized image loading, critical CSS inlining
- **FID < 100ms**: Minimal JavaScript, efficient event handling
- **CLS < 0.1**: Stable layouts, proper image dimensions
- **TTFB < 200ms**: Optimized server processing, efficient queries

### 3. Modern Web Standards
- **ES6+ JavaScript**: Modern, efficient code
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Native layout systems
- **WebP & AVIF**: Next-gen image formats
- **HTTP/2 & HTTP/3**: Modern protocol support

### 4. Developer Experience
- **Clean code output**: Semantic HTML, optimized CSS
- **Extensible architecture**: Easy to customize and extend
- **Modern APIs**: REST API, hooks, filters
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples

## Performance Metrics We Target

| Metric | Target | Industry Average |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Plugin Size** | < 2MB | 15-25MB |
| **Initial Load** | < 100ms | 500-1000ms |
| **Memory Usage** | < 5MB | 20-50MB |
| **Database Queries** | < 3 | 10-20 |
| **HTTP Requests** | < 5 | 15-30 |
| **LCP** | < 2.5s | > 4s |
| **FID** | < 100ms | > 300ms |
| **CLS** | < 0.1 | > 0.25 |

## The Future of Page Building

We envision a future where:

- **Performance is the default**, not an afterthought
- **Core Web Vitals are optimized** out of the box
- **Developers have the tools** to build fast, accessible sites
- **Users enjoy** lightning-fast, smooth experiences
- **The web becomes** faster, more efficient, and more sustainable

## Join the Performance Revolution

Embroidery isn't just a page builder—it's a movement toward a faster, more efficient web. Every line of code we write, every feature we add, every decision we make is guided by one question:

**"Does this make the web faster?"**

If the answer is no, we don't build it.
