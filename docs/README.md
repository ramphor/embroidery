## Definitions

### Element

In Embroidery, the main component is the 'Element'. An element is an visual entity that gets rendered on the page and can be controlled by the user in the editor.<br>
There are three types of elements in Embroidery: Section, Column, and Widget.<br>
A standard Element structure consists of the following settings and functions:

* ID
* Name
* Icon (in case of a widget)
* Category (in case of a widget)
* List of setting controls (Text / Select / Color Picker etc.)
* Preview render function - Written as a Backbone JavaScript template
* Frontend HTML render function - Written in PHP

### The Editor

The editor is the editing environment in which the user creates and edits elements on the page. To learn more about the editor you can read [this article](content/the-editor.md).

### Controls

Controls are different types of input fields and UI elements that are used to construct the UI of elements.<br>
For more information about controls, Please refer to [this article](content/controls/README.md).<br>
Embroidery includes a wide array of controls:

##### Default settings

* [Text](content/controls/_text.md) - Simple text field
* [Number](content/controls/_number.md) - Simple number field
* [Textarea](content/controls/_textarea.md) - Textarea field
* [URL](content/controls/_url.md) - Text field to add link + button to open the link in an external tab (target=_blank)
* [Media](content/controls/_media.md) (Image) - Choose an image from the WordPress media library
* [Gallery](content/controls/_gallery.md) - Create a gallery of images from the WordPress media library
* [WYSIWYG](content/controls/_wysiwyg.md) - The WordPress text editor (TinyMCE)
